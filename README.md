**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmeditor)`**

I'm beginner developer and a student, who wants to develop skills in coding and learn a new things about it. My favorite language is C++ but is slowly changing to HTML. I'm here to share my works and learn from more experience developers how they're coding.
